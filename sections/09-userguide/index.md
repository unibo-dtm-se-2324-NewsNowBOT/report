## User page
 
On the user page they'll find a search bar and two sections
 
1. The Search bar is currently not working but the idea is that users can enter a keyword to find news containing it (this feature is not currently available but may be developed in future versions).
 
2. In the "Breaking News" section, users can read the latest news from 4 different sources.
 
If they click on the news article, they will be directed to the proper website where they can read the full article
 
3. In the "Comments and ratings" section, users can select a news article, write a comment and give a rating from 1 (terrible) to 5 (excellent).
 
They can also see the comments and ratings left by other users on a specific news article.
