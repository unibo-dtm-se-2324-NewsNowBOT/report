# Self-evaluation

## Alice Sturaro
I worked on building and testing the backend of NewsNowBot. My main job was to set up Firebase, which handles user logins and stores all our data. I made sure users could safely log in and that all their information was stored and updated instantly.
I successfully set up several key features: the login system using Firebase Authentication, the database system using Cloud Firestore, and security measures to protect user data. I tested everything thoroughly, from how users log in to how the database performs. The result was a reliable system that lets users interact with news and comments in real-time, while keeping their data safe.
The project went well, but there's always room to get better. Since I was new to Firebase, it took me some time to learn it properly. We could improve our testing process by adding more automated tests, especially for the user interface. We could also make our database queries work faster when handling lots of data. Going forward, I want to learn more about making Firebase work even better and create more automated tests to make our system stronger and more efficient.
