# Self-evaluation

## Alice Sturaro
I worked on building and testing the backend of NewsNowBot. My main job was to set up Firebase, which handles user logins and stores all our data. I made sure users could safely log in and that all their information was stored and updated instantly.
I successfully set up several key features: the login system using Firebase Authentication, the database system using Cloud Firestore, and security measures to protect user data. I tested everything thoroughly, from how users log in to how the database performs. The result was a reliable system that lets users interact with news and comments in real-time, while keeping their data safe.
The project went well, but there's always room to get better. Since I was new to Firebase, it took me some time to learn it properly. We could improve our testing process by adding more automated tests, especially for the user interface. We could also make our database queries work faster when handling lots of data. Going forward, I want to learn more about making Firebase work even better and create more automated tests to make our system stronger and more efficient.

During the development of the project, my primary responsibility was handling the HTML and CSS for all the pages.
I focused on structuring the layout, ensuring responsiveness, and linking the various pages together. This experience allowed me to improve my front-end development skills, particularly in styling with CSS and organizing clean, maintainable code. Additionally, I collaborated with my teammates to integrate the visual components with the backend, ensuring a seamless user experience.

In addition to development, I also contributed to testing the platform. I created both a user and an admin account to verify the functionality of different features. As a regular user, I tested interactions by leaving ratings and comments, ensuring that these features worked correctly and displayed properly.

Overall, I am very satisfied with the work done. The project functions as intended, meeting the original objectives. I also had a great experience working with my team, as collaboration was smooth and productive. Since my background is in economics and this was my first software engineering project, I found it especially rewarding to apply new technical skills and actively contribute to the development process.

This software engineering project was my first experience in web development, as my background is in economics.  
Working alongside my colleague Alessandro, I contributed to structuring the website layout.  
My primary focus was on developing the administrator page, which allowed me to enhance my skills in HTML and CSS.  
Throughout the project, I learned a lot about web development and improved my ability to create a functional and well-structured website.  
I am very happy with how the project turned out—it is fully functional.
