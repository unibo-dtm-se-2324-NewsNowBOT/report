# Release

## 6. RELEASE
 
The **NewsNowBot** web application release includes the entire frontend and backend services, ensuring all components are publicly accessible. It is published on GitHub as the central repository for code and versioning, while deployment to Firebase Hosting makes the application accessible globally through a live web interface.
The release process is automated through **GitHub Actions**, which triggers the deployment pipeline whenever new changes are pushed to the repository. Given the nature of Firebase Hosting, the system does not follow strict semantic versioning (SemVer) but ensures clear tracking of updates and deployments.
 
**NewsNowBot** is distributed under the **MIT License**, a permissive open-source license allowing users to freely use, modify, and distribute the software with proper attribution. This choice aligns with the project's educational objectives, fostering collaboration and encouraging contributions from the open-source community.
