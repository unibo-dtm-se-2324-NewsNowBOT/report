# Validation
## Testing

### Test Overview

Here's our testing strategy for the **NewsNowBOT** app. We test key functions like sign-up, login, comments, RSS feeds, and user interface. Each test checks if the app works properly and meets our quality standards.

**Test Development Process**

For NewsNowBOT, we adopted a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach, which allowed us to simulate real-world scenarios to verify that each feature meets its requirements. The testing process was structured in three main stages:

1.  **Unit Testing**: Individual components and functions were tested, including registration, login, comment submission, and Firestore interactions.
2.  **Integration Testing**: Ensured that the components work together, such as testing how the registration system interacts with Firestore and how comments are synchronized in real-time.
3.  **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**: Simulated user flows to verify that the entire system works as expected from registration to comment submission and feed updates.

-   **Success Rate**: The tests were designed to achieve a 100% success rate.
-   **Coverage**: The tests cover registration, login persistence, comment submission, RSS feed updates, and interface responsiveness.
-   **Acceptance Criteria Validation**: Each test aligns with the acceptance criteria to ensure that all functional requirements are met.

**Acceptance Test Cases and Criteria**

1.  **User Registration**

    -   **Acceptance Criteria**: The user must register with a valid email and a secure password. Error messages should appear for invalid inputs, and a confirmation message should display upon successful registration.
-   **Acceptance Test**:
   
    -   Test valid inputs (email, password) to ensure successful registration and confirmation.
    -   Attempt registration with an existing email to check for the error message.
    -   Test with weak passwords or invalid emails to confirm proper validation.

2.  **User Login Persistence**

    -   **Acceptance Criteria**: Once logged in, the user should stay authenticated across sessions, even after refreshing the page. If the user is not authenticated, they should be redirected to the login page.
    -   **Acceptance Test**:
        
        -   Log in with valid credentials, refresh the page, and verify session persistence.
        -   Log out and attempt to access a protected page to ensure redirection to the login page.

3.  **Comment Submission and Synchronization**

    -   **Acceptance Criteria**: An authenticated user should be able to submit comments on news articles. Comments must be saved in Firestore and displayed in real-time for all users.
    -   **Acceptance Test**:
        
        -   Submit a comment and verify it is saved in Firestore and displayed in real-time.
        -   Test that comments synchronize correctly between users viewing the same article.

4.  **RSS Feed Updates**

    -   **Acceptance Criteria**: The system must fetch and display the latest RSS feed updates without significant delay.
    -   **Acceptance Test**:

        -   Verify that the news list is updated automatically with the latest feeds after a refresh or periodic update.
        -   Ensure new articles are correctly displayed for all users.

5. **Security and Permissions**
    
    -   **Acceptance Criteria**: Different user roles (authenticated users and administrators) should have appropriate access to features and data.
    -   **Acceptance Test**:

        - Test access control to ensure regular users can only access their data, while administrators can manage user accounts and comments.
